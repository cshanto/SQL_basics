# SQL_basics
-- This is short Library Management System Database
-- Its goal is to implement fundamental MySQL queries
-- Following are the phases of the entire Database System
-- 1. Database Schema [Here: Library]
-- Database Schema is the blueprint of the Database containing the relationships of the tables in it.
-- All tables in the schema {ERD is given}
-- : Books table, Authors table, Users table, and Transactions table
-- 2.Create the mentioned tables with Primary Keys(PM) ans Foreign Keys(FK) for relationships
-- 3. Populate the created tables with appropriate data
-- 4. Perform basic Operations(SQl Queries) :
-- * Adding new books and authors to the system
-- * Registerig new users
-- * Borrowing and returning books
-- * Retrieeving a list of books that are available
-- * Displaying users borrowing history

-- 5.Perform complex operations : 
-- * Find the most borrowed book
-- * Identify user with most borrowed book
-- * Calculate late returns and fines
-- 6. Reporting :
-- * Create SQL queries for generating reports on overdue books, ppopular genre, and activity summary
-- 7. Indexing and Optimization :
-- Experiment with indexing on appropriate columns to optimize query performance, especially for large datasets. 

-- note : Kindly ignore if any mistakes are found. And I will try to add more stuffs into it
